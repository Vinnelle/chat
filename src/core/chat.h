// fetch it. They then ask for a window of chunks at a time ("fg") and the sender sends them in
// the slots that would otherwise carry a nop ("fd"), so a transfer looks the same as normal
// traffic. Through the relays it's two per slot. With fast transfers on, a peer's slots come much
// closer together during a transfer: faster, but visible as a burst (through the relays, only as
// close as they allow). Each chunk goes in its place in the window, and a run of missing chunks is
// requested again. A complete window is written in order and hashed, and the file is only kept if
// the hash matches the offer.
